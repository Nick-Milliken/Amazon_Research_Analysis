Amazon's Marketplace Research 
======

My objective was to gain some insight into Amazon's marketplace. With the importance of office culture becoming more of a priority, I decided to investigate healthy office snacks. With a search for "healthy office snacks", I gathered 24 different products that Amazon offers. I entered the data from Amazon into a spreadsheet and then loaded that into Tableau to visualize what I found.

While the results may differ with time you can see what appears with the search "healthy office snacks" [here.](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=healthy+office+snacks&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)

My end goal was to find some indicators that would help me narrow down a sweet spot to position my product–if I were to sell office snack boxes through Amazon. 

I found some interesting takeaways from my research that would give a marketing company an edge in positioning their office snack box product in the Amazon marketplace. One of the first discoveries that came to me was how Amazon ranks their products. I found that there is no correlation between the customer review rating and where Amazon ranks the product within a certain category. There is also no correlation between the number of reviews and a product’s rank. I have charts below showing how I came to these conclusions. 

One thing that I would like to point out here is the categories and subcategories.
Here are some links explaining how to choose your categories and subcategories for your product.

When I was adding the data into the spreadsheet I wanted to create my own unique ID for every product to make it easier to reference on my charts and graphs. You can access and download the spreadsheet in the data folder or by clicking [here](https://github.com/Stevenlutton/AmazonResearch/blob/master/Data/My_Amazon_Market_Research.xlsx)

### Product 21A - “Cracker Assortments”

I started by examining how many reviews each product had. Product 21A had the most reviews by a very large margin. Product 21A had 1,723 reviews while product 8A had the second most reviews with 422. The average number of reviews for all of the products was 218.5.

Here is an example of where you find the review star rating and rankings for a product.

For all of the products in this analysis, Amazon has them ranked in a category called: “Grocery & Gourmet Food”. Amazon then has them listed in different subcategories. 

-14/24 of the subcategories fall under “Snack Food Gifts”

-3/24 don’t have information available

-2/24 fall under “Snack Nuts & Seeds”

-and for “Whole Grain Bars”, “Cracker Assortments”, “Food Assortment & Variety Gifts”, “Granola Bars”, and “High Protein Bars” there are 1 each.

Product 21A (Variety Fun Office Snacks (160 Count) - Bulk Assortment - Over 15 Pounds of Chips Cookies & Candy) was the product labeled as “Cracker Assortments” which I found to be interesting. I’m curious if this specific product gained so much more attention than any of the others I looked at because of its specific category. 

Higher # of Reviews does not equal higher rank, however. 

**Product 21A scored 24th out of 24 in Amazon’s “Grocery & Gourmet Foods” category with a ranking of 214,562.**

I sorted the data to show the top 10 highest ranked in the “Grocery & Gourmet Foods” category since all of the products and their subcategories fell under that umbrella. The first thing that I found interesting was the highest ranked product, 2A, had the lowest star review rating (3.6/5) out of all 24 products. This shows me that there is no direct correlation between how consumers review the product and how Amazon ranks them within this category.

## Overall Rankings

I was not surprised to find that the products that have a higher ranking within the “Grocery &Gourmet Food” category also tend to have a higher ranking in whichever subcategory Amazon puts them in. Visualizing this helped me to quickly determine which products were not ranked very high compared to the rest of the products. (21A, 12A, 10A, 20A, 16A, 23A)

Alternatively, when I narrowed the filters down to include only the products within the top 30,000 for “Grocery & Gourmet Foods” we can determine some products that are doing well according to the rankings, and are all almost in the top 100 of their respective subcategory. (2A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 15A, 17A, 9A, and 25A) Most of these fall under the “Snack Food Gifts” category, however, it is important to note the success of 25A and 7A, which fall under the subcategories “Whole Grain Bars” and “High Protein Bars, respectively.
