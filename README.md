Amazon's Marketplace Research 
======

If you would like to see the marketplace click here (

My objective was to gain some insight into Amazon's marketplace. With the importance of office culture becoming more of a priority, I decided to investigate office snack boxes. With a search for "office snack boxes", I gathered 24 different products that Amazon offers. I entered the data from Amazon into a spreadsheet and then loaded that into Tableau to visualize what I found.

My end goal was to find some indicators that would help me narrow down a sweet spot to position my product–if I were to sell office snack boxes through Amazon. 

I found some interesting takeaways from my research that would give a marketing company an edge in positioning their office snack box product in the Amazon marketplace. One of the first discoveries that came to me was how Amazon ranks their products. I found that there is no correlation between the customer review rating and where Amazon ranks the product within a certain category. There is also no correlation between the number of reviews and a product’s rank. I have charts below showing how I came to these conclusions. 

One thing that I would like to point out here is the categories and subcategories. Here (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G23531) (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/10471?language=en_US&ref=efph_10471_cont_G23531)
are some links explaining how to choose your categories and subcategories for your product. 
 
**_I believe this is a very important–if not the most important decision for a company entering Amazon’s marketplace_**



###Product 21A - “Cracker Assortments”

I started by examining how many reviews each product had. Product 21A had the most reviews by a very large margin. Product 21A had 1,723 reviews while product 8A had the second most reviews with 422. The average number of reviews for all of the products was 218.5.
