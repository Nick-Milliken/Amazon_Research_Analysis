Amazon's Marketplace Research 
======

My objective was to gain some insight into Amazon's marketplace. With the importance of office culture becoming more of a priority, I decided to investigate office snack boxes. With a search for "office snack boxes", I gathered 24 different products that Amazon offers. I entered the data from Amazon into a spreadsheet and then loaded that into Tableau to visualize what I found.

While the results may differ with time you can see what appears with the search "office snack boxes" [here.](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=office+snack+boxes&ref=nb_sb_noss)

My end goal was to find some indicators that would help me narrow down a sweet spot to position my product–if I were to sell office snack boxes through Amazon. 

I found some interesting takeaways from my research that would give a marketing company an edge in positioning their office snack box product in the Amazon marketplace. One of the first discoveries that came to me was how Amazon ranks their products. I found that there is no correlation between the customer review rating and where Amazon ranks the product within a certain category. There is also no correlation between the number of reviews and a product’s rank. I have charts below showing how I came to these conclusions. 

One thing that I would like to point out here is the categories and subcategories.
Here are some links explaining how to choose your categories and subcategories for your product.

**_I believe this is a very important–if not the most important decision for a company entering Amazon’s marketplace_**

When I was adding the data into the spreadsheet I wanted to create my own unique ID for every product to make it easier to reference on my charts and graphs. You can access and download the spreadsheet in the data folder or by clicking [here](https://github.com/Stevenlutton/AmazonResearch/blob/master/Data/My_Amazon_Market_Research.xlsx)

### Product 21A - “Cracker Assortments”

I started by examining how many reviews each product had. Product 21A had the most reviews by a very large margin. Product 21A had 1,723 reviews while product 8A had the second most reviews with 422. The average number of reviews for all of the products was 218.5.

Here is an example of where you find the review star rating and rankings for a product.

For all of the products in this analysis, Amazon has them ranked in a category called: “Grocery & Gourmet Food”. Amazon then has them listed in different subcategories. 
14/24 of the subcategories fall under “Snack Food Gifts”
3/24 don’t have information available
2/24 fall under “Snack Nuts & Seeds”
and for “Whole Grain Bars”, “Cracker Assortments”, “Food Assortment & Variety Gifts”, “Granola Bars”, and “High Protein Bars” there are 1 each.
